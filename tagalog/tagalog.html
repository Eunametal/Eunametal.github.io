                <h2>What is Tagalog?</h2>
                <p>Tagalog is a language that is spoken by many Filipinos. Most people that speak Tagalog are from region of Luzon. According to Dynamic Language, it is one of the first languages most Filipinos learn and more than 50 million Filipinos speak Tagalog.</p>
                <p>According to Language Star, Tagalog was derived from the words "taga-ilog", which means from the river. Tagalog was also influenced by mainly our colonizers, and the Malays and Chinese. During the colonial period of Spain, Tagalog's writing system was changed from Baybayin into the Roman alphabet, which is what's mainly used in present time.</p>
                <h2>Tagalog is the only benefiter of Baybayin</h2>
                <p>During the drafting of the 1935 constitution, Tagalog was declared as the national language of the Philippines. This decision caused uproar from those who speak other languages beside Tagalog. That is why the national language was later changed to Filipino, where it generalizes all the language into one language that a Flipino speaks.</p>

                <p>This is one of the reasons why we can't change our current writing system for something that is mainly derived from speaking Tagalog. There are many more languages in the Philippines, and apart from the languages, more writing systems besides Baybayin. Making Baybayin the national writing system will also pose a challenge since everyone in the country must now adapt to the new writing system in a time where English is also heavily used by many Filipinos.</p>
