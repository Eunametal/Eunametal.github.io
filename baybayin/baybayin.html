                <h2>What is Baybayin?</h2>
                <p>Baybayin is a pre-Spanish writing system used in the Philippines. It is a part of the Brahmic family and has been recorded to be used during the 16th century. </p>

                <p>The term "Baybay" literally means "to spell" in Tagalog. It is one of the ways to write Tagalog. Tagalog is one the Philippine's languages and is mostly spoken in Central and parts of Northern Luzon, but Baybayin also gave birth to other scripts that was used in other parts of the Philippines. According to Mandirigma.org (1999), there are a number of scripts that came from Baybayin, namely Hanunó’o, Buhid, Tagbanwa, Kapampangan script and the Bisaya script.</p>

                <h2>Why did Filipinos stop using Baybayin?</h2>
                <p>According to Comandate (2017), Baybayin was widely used in the country before the Spanish conquest in 1668 when the script was removed from the Doctrina Christiana. Essentially, it died when the Spaniards took over the country and when they introduced a new language and writing system to us, forcibly eleminating it.</p>

                <h2>Why is there a need for Baybayin to be revived?</h2>
                <p>Today, efforts are being made to promote the script across the country. The National Museum and Commission on Culture and Arts have devoted areas in their offices to showcase the written forms. Taklobo Baybayin Group, Mangyan Heritage Center, Lucban Historical Society and schools like La Consolacion College (Bacolod) and  Bucan Grande in Surigao have been active in patronizing and promoting the written forms of Baybayin. The government also made an effort to revive Baybayin through House Bill 1022 or the proposed "National Writing System Act". The measure seeks to declare Baybayin as the national writing system, generating greater awareness on the plight of Baybayin and foster wider appreciation on its importance and beauty.</p>
                <p>When we look at the reasons that people say when asked why it should be revived, one of the reasons is that it should be revived since it is part of the Filipino identity. It is part of our history and learning Baybayin is also learning more about how our ancestors communicated. Another reason is that our current writing system came from the Spaniards instead of originating from us. Learning baybayin will serve as an antidote for a nation grappling with its colonial past as stated by France-Pesse (2019).</p>

                <h2>Why Baybayin shouldn't be revived</h2>
                <p>I do think that it's important to keep Baybayin alive and actually preserve it, but this doesn't mean that we have to make it our new writing system in replacement of our current modern one. I'm not against in reviving Baybayin, I think it's really important that everyone learns about this, but the practicality of it is the real question. Would it really be practical for everyone to relearn a new writing system, to replace our current one just because it's a way to identify as a Filipino and because it's a part of our culture? Even if it's nice to have a writing system that was created by our ancestors, I just think that the disadvantages outweigh the benefits. According to France-Presse of Inquirer (2019), it has been said that such revival would only benefit those who speak Tagalog and will result in the elimination of other languages. There are many more scripts found in the Philippines that used by other languages, some examples are Basahan of the Bicolanos, the Badlit of the Visayans, the Kurdita of the Ilocanos, the Kulitan of the Kapampangans, the Hanunuo and Buhid scripts of the Mangyans, the Tagbanua script of the Tagbanuas, and the Jawi of the Tausugs. The statement of Michael Pangilinan, who is an advocate of the Kulitan script of Pampanga, "The Philippines has become a country only for Tagalogs" will come to life, if the decision to make Baybayin as the national writing system would come true.</p>
